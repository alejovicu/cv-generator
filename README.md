# cv-generator
CV generator with data provided from LinkedIn + some custom data on config files.

I don't know why companies stills requesting PDF CV and "Cover Letter" to apply to their job offers. This is kind of deprecated now with services LinkedIn or "resume.io" where you can keep your information up to date. 

The Idea of this project is provide a tool extract the data from linkedin and generate an static site with this data and also have the option to print it on PDF if you want or create your personal site with it.
